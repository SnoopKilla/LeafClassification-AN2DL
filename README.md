# LeafClassification-AN2DL
The goal of this project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network in order to classify images of leaves according to the species of the plant to which they belong. A complete report of the architecture of the Network and the results achieved can be found [here](https://github.com/SnoopKilla/LeafClassification-AN2DL/blob/main/Report.pdf).
